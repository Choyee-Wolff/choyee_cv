								Air pollution is one of the deadliest environmental risks today. According to the State of Global Air Report (2024), it ranked as the second leading risk factor for death in 2021, contributing to over 8.1 million deaths worldwide. Among the cities struggling with severe pollution, Chiang Mai, Thailand, stands out due to its seasonal PM2.5 crisis, primarily caused by agricultural burning, traffic congestion, and outdated vehicle emissions.

									<h3><strong>Data-Driven Insights: Understanding the Sources of Pollution</strong></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									To analyze air pollution in Chiang Mai, multiple data sources were used:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Health and air pollutant data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME, 2021).</li>
									<li>Forest fire alerts from Global Forest Watch (2025).</li>
									<li>Real-time air quality forecasts from AQICN (2025).</li>
									<li>Population statistics from Macrotrends (2025).</li>
									<li>Traffic congestion data from TomTom (2025).</li>
								</ul>

									<h3><strong>Key Findings</strong></h3>
								</header>
								<header>
									<h1><strong>Weekly Air Quality Forecast (Heatmap) </strong></h1>
								</header>
								<a class="image featured"><img src="images/pollution1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										The heatmap highlights consistently high levels of PM2.5 in Chiang Mai, Thailand, particularly at the start and end of the week, with values exceeding 100 on most days. These levels indicate unhealthy air quality, especially for sensitive groups. (IQAir, 2025) This trend underscores the need for targeted actions to reduce fine particulate matter emissions during these critical periods.
PM10 levels are moderate, ranging between 50 and 75. While not as hazardous as PM2.5, these levels may still cause mild discomfort for healthy individuals and pose risks to vulnerable populations. In contrast, ozone and UVI levels remain consistently low throughout the week.</p>

										<h1><strong>Top 10 Risk Factors in Thailand  </strong></h1>
									</header>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/pollution2.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The bar chart highlights that air pollution is among the top 10 risk factors for health issues in Thailand, with particulate matter pollution, such as PM2.5, playing a significant role in this burden. This underscores the critical impact of air pollution on public health and its contribution to a range of health complications.

										<h1><strong>PM2.5 Deaths as Percentage of Population: Wales vs Thailand</strong></h1>
									</header>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/pollution3.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The bar chart compares PM2.5 related deaths as a percentage of the population in Thailand and Wales from 2013 to 2021. It shows a significantly lower percentage in Wales, reflecting better air quality and reduced health risks compared to Thailand. This stark contrast highlights the severe impact of air pollution in Thailand.</p>

									<header>
										<h1><strong>Comparison of Congestion Levels: Wales vs Thailand line</strong></h1>
									</header>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/pollution4.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The line chart in Figure 8 compares congestion levels in Wales and Chiang Mai, Thailand, throughout the year. It reveals consistently lower congestion levels in Wales, showcasing the effectiveness of its traffic management and transport systems. In contrast, Chiang Mai experiences significantly higher congestion, particularly during the latter months, highlighting the challenges of managing urban mobility in Thailand.</p>
											
									<header>
										<h1><strong>PM2.5 and Fire Alerts Over Years</strong></h1>
									</header>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/pollution5.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>	The chart illustrates a strong correlation between fire alerts and PM2.5 levels, with significant spikes observed during Week 14, typically in April each year. This period coincides with widespread agricultural burning and forest fires in Chiang Mai and its surrounding areas, which are major contributors to Thailand's air pollution. </p>

								<header>
									<h3><strong>A Call for Action</strong></h3>
								</header>								
								<p>
									Air pollution in Chiang Mai is more than just a seasonal nuisance; it is a public health crisis. Immediate action is required to enforce stricter regulations, educate communities, and invest in sustainable solutions. With a collective effort, policymakers, businesses, and residents can work together to ensure a cleaner, healthier future for Chiang Mai and beyond. </p>
